Launchy 2.5
PLEASE READ THIS!
When Launchy runs it disappears to the background.  You have to press
‘alt+space’ (control+space in Linux) in order to see Launchy.  If Launchy is new
for you please read the rest of this short manual.
Welcome
Launchy was first created for my own use, but as my friends and I began to
heavily rely upon it and its lack of cost, I decided to distribute it.  The official
homepage for Launchy is 
http://www.launchy.net
.If you need help using
Launchy or would like to leave any comments/suggestions please feel free to
post on the forums.

What is Launchy?
Launchy is the most efficient way to open files, folders, websites, and
programs on your computer.  Nobody likes to hunt through the start menu to
find an application, just to find that the application is hidden under some
obscure folder named after a company you have never heard of!  Instead,
Launchy is a smart search program which tries to guess which program or file
you are looking for and will launch it when you hit the enter key.  It is only
visible when you hit the alt+space key combination; otherwise it hides in the
background.  Once you have used it for a few days, it becomes an indispensable
utility for your computer.  And it’s free!
